# Concrete Crack Classification Project

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify concrete images as either with cracks or without cracks. Identifying cracks early on can prevent potential structural failures, improving safety and durability in construction. This project follows a full machine learning workflow, from problem formulation to model deployment.

## Project Overview

Concrete cracks, if left untreated, may compromise the structural integrity of buildings and endanger lives. This project involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify concrete as either having cracks or being crack-free. Achieving high accuracy in this classification task can significantly impact construction safety, as early detection enables timely maintenance.

## Project Criteria

Training and validation accuracy of more than 90%.

Avoid model overfitting.

Apply transfer learning if necessary.

Deploy the trained model for prediction on test data.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project can be found on Mendeley Data. Please download the dataset directly from the source and place it in the designated folder for this project. The dataset consists of images of concrete surfaces with and without cracks.

## Workflow

### The project workflow follows the standard machine learning pipeline:

Problem Formulation: Define the classification task and set project goals.

Data Preparation: Load, preprocess, and split the data into training, validation, and test sets.

Model Development: Design a CNN architecture, optionally using transfer learning to improve performance.

Model Training: Train the model using early stopping to prevent overfitting, and monitor performance using TensorBoard.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance on validation data, saving reports and performance metrics.

Model Deployment: Deploy the model to make predictions on new data.

## Model Architecture

The model is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture suitable for image classification. Transfer learning techniques are applied to leverage pre-trained weights for better generalization and faster convergence.

## Training

### The training process includes:

Training with validation monitoring using early stopping to prevent overfitting.

TensorBoard to track training progress.

Model checkpoints to save the best-performing model.

Evaluation

Accuracy metrics and confusion matrix are used to evaluate performance.

Performance results are saved for analysis and reporting.

## Model Deployment

The trained model is saved in .h5 format and is used to predict on test images to confirm generalizability. Deployment scripts allow easy loading of the model for inference on new data.
